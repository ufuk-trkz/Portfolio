## Projects

### Project 0: SNIPIT

Snipit is a purely audio based Social Media. Users can follow others and post short Snipits (up to 9 seconds). These Snipits can be commented and every comment can be commented also. Users can enable auto-play, which, while enabled, plays all Snipits in one's feed chronologically. Users can also like Snipts and comments.

Users are shown Snipits of other users they aren't following yet in the Discovery Feed. In the Discovery Feed, users can search for specific users via name or their Snipit handle. Users can share Snipits and comments via message to other users and also chat with them via audio.

NOTE: This app isn't on the Appstore yet. It will be in beta testing soon, hopefully. It still has major bugs that have to be worked on. This app is being created by Özgün Yildiz and me.

### Project 1: Schematic Capture

An iOS app for capturing and annotating huge machines in some of the countries larger steel manufacturing facilities. It needs offline capabilities to be able to capture photos and annotate them in facilities that often have no network or signal available to them.

- Collaborated remotely with a team of 5 Web Developers and an UX Designer to build a cross platform application in 8 weeks.
- Built User Interface using UIKit
- Solely responsible for the implementation of the UX Design
- Replaced Firebase with Okta for authentication
- Implemented SwiftyDropbox to enable uploading images from the app to Dropbox

### Project 2: PlantWise
With PlantWise you can create a watering schedule for your plants and get notifications when they're thirsty. This is synced across multiple devices, so the whole family is up to date.
